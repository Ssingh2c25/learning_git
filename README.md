# Learning GIT and GitHub

## What is a Repository?

A **GitHub repository (repo)** is a storage space on **GitHub** where you can keep your project's files, including code, documentation, images, and more. It also tracks all changes made to those files over time, using **Git version control**.

## Key Points about a GitHub Repository

### 📁 Project Storage
A repository is like a folder where all your project's code and files are kept.

### 🕒 Version Control
Every change you or others make is tracked. You can view the history, revert to previous versions, or collaborate without overwriting others' work.

### 🤝 Collaboration
Multiple people can work on the same project, suggest changes (**Pull Requests**), and review code together.

### 🔒 Public or Private
Repositories can be **public** (anyone can see) or **private** (only selected people have access).

### 🔄 Clone & Fork
- **Clone**: Download the repository to your local machine to work on it.
- **Fork**: Create your own copy of someone else's repository for experimentation or personal use.

### 📝 README.md
Most repositories include a **README.md** file that explains:
- What the project is about
- How to use it
- How to contribute to it
